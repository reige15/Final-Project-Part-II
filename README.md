# User Research Protocol 

## Research Questions/Script and what I hope to learn: 
I am conducting this interview in hope to get clarity on changes my storyboard may need as well as get any feedback. Are you able to see what I sent/am sharing? Great! Thank you for your time with this matter and participation. This should only take about 10 minutes. I will be taking notes while we talk, so sorry for that in advance.  

      
      What was your main takeaway from the storyboard as it stands now?
		
      Were you confused by anything?
      
      Was anything hard to read or in a font that was hard to see?
      
      Do you feel like there is a call to action?
      
      Do you understand the importance of the topic?
      
      Is there any other feedback you have?

Thank you again for your time. 

## Documented Findings: 
# The target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
I want my target audience to be educated people, college level or above who may be able to change the way medical information is conveyed to the public and patients. 
# Your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
I interviewed available people who fit in my criteria for my audience. I interviewed my sister who is currently in law school, my mom who is a physician and my friend who is in my program but not this class. This will give me a good insight into what I need to change and what I do well and how my target audience is recieving this information. However, these people may able be bias considering they know me.

# Changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
Since my interview I think I will be changing a few things about my storyboard, they are listed below: 

  
      1. I would like to make the images bigger and probably will keep the begginning format of the words over the images consistent for the entirety of the storyboard 	
      (so that there is more time to look at the visuals and they are bigger, but then the words will follow and guide to the next image and so on) 
      
      2. I will be sure to better label my graphs/charts are to be sure that at first glance my audience will understand what is going on 
      
      3. I will use more easily understod data visualizations to guide my story to the conclusion that is necessary 
      
      4. I will eliminate one of the graphs that is redundant and also does not add anything (the second graph about the health literacy rate by state)
      
      5. I will be more explicit in the comparision of health literacy to literacy
